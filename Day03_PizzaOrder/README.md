# 🍕 Day 3: Pizza Order Program

This Python project simulates a pizza ordering system where users can customize their order with size, pepperoni, and extra cheese.

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Boolean logic
- Taking user input
- String comparison
- Nesting conditions

🧾 A small project that helped build logic and understand decision-making in code!
